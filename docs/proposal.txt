Our idea involves an analysis of live data that is accessible from Google Sets, essentially data from search queries.  We would like to implement a system that, provided a source word and destination word, determines the path of related search queries that somehow connect the two, demonstrating the small world phenomenon.

For instance, given "wine" and "France", it may return a list resembling 

wine
grapes
cold climate
northern hemisphere
Europe
France

The resulting graph will also be analyzed using the methods provided by igraph.

We will start with a single word, and we can collect related words by the above method, creating a small network in which every related word connects to the root word with an edge. We then iterate through the next word to appear on the list, treating it as a root word and so on, creating new edges.  We plan to stop the iteration (and network creation) after finding a chosen destination word, or after a set "depth" and reporting that there was no path connecting the two chosen words.
